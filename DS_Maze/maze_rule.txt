Walk Rules
	Romeo: start from (0,1,1) and stop at (1,99,99) of the maze, and it walks according to the rule that Upstairs > Right > Down > Up > 
Left. Additionally, Romeo will not go downstairs when he hasalready gone upstairs.
	Juliet: start from (1,99,99) and stop at (0,1,1) of the maze, and it walks according to the rule that Downstairs > Left > Up > Down > Right. Additionally, Juliet will not go upstairs when she hasalready gone downstairs.
	Romeo goes one step further before Juliet goes one step. 
	The road traveled will not be visited again unless there is no way to go, which avoids the infinite loop.
	The stair is a portal, that is, when somebody reaches the stair, goes straight up or down one floor.
Termination Condition:
	They meet each other.
	One of them arrives at its destination first.
